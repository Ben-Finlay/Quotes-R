('Jiddu Krishnamurti',  'When you call yourself an Indian or a Muslim or a Christian or a European, or anything else, you are being violent. Do you see why it is violent? Because you are separating yourself from the rest of humankind. When you separate yourself by belief, by nationality, by tradition, it breeds violence. So a person who is seeking to understand violence does not belong to any country, to any religion, to any political party or partial system; they are concerned with the total understanding of humankind.'),
